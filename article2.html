				<h3>Article 2</h3>
				<p>Cyberbullying, which happens online, has been getting worse, especially for kids and teenagers. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened it because more people were using the internet. Cyberbullying occurs when someone says mean things, spreads lies, or tries to hurt someone’s feelings on purpose online. It can make people feel sad, lonely, or like they aren’t good enough. While we know regular bullying can hurt people, we don’t know as much about how cyberbullying can make someone feel so sad that they might want to hurt themselves. Unfortunately, there have been cases where cyberbullying has led to people taking their own lives, showing how serious the problem is.

                According to Ariel Schonfeld, et. al. (2023), "The incidences of both cyberbullying and adolescent suicide are rising in the United States, with recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showing that 14.9 percent of adolescents have been cyberbullied and 13.6 percent of adolescents have made a serious suicide attempt." This shows that cyberbullying is becoming a bigger problem for kids. When children are bullied online, they can feel unfortunate, and lonely, and believe they aren’t good enough. Some kids feel so hopeless because of this bullying that they think about hurting themselves. In some cases, kids have even taken their own lives because of the pain, which is now called "cyberbullicide." This is why it’s so important to stop cyberbullying and help those who are struggling. 
               
               When a child dies because of cyberbullying, parents feel a deep, painful sadness and often blame themselves. They wonder if they missed signs or could have done something differently to protect their child. The loss is overwhelming, and they are left with many questions that may never be answered. This grief lasts a lifetime, and the impact is felt in every part of their lives. Losing a child to something like cyberbullying shows just how serious the effects can be, and how much it can hurt a child’s mental and emotional health.
               
               Cyberbullying is increasing, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, and it's impacting kids and teens negatively. Victims often feel sad, and lonely, and sometimes think about self-harm or suicide. Studies show rising rates of both cyberbullying and suicide among adolescents. When a child dies from cyberbullying, parents are left with overwhelming grief and guilt. This highlights the importance of understanding the serious effects cyberbullying can have on children’s mental health.
