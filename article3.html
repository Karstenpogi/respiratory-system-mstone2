                    When bullying happens online, it can feel like you're being attacked everywhere, even at home. There could appear to be no escape route. The most typical symptoms of cyberbullying include insecurity and obsessive thoughts about what other people think or say about your entire life, including what you do, say, publish, or look like. Victims may also start to feel ashamed and anxious. Generally speaking, all of these result in negative thoughts and the beginning of self-talk, social isolation, guilt regarding deeds or inactions, or a feeling of unfavorable judgment. Cyberbullying typically harms a victim's attendance and academic performance, especially if the victim is a student. This is especially true if the bullying happens both in person and online, the victim needs to speak up about this issue. Because of the stress and mental pain caused by cyberbullying, kids and teens may resort to unhealthy coping strategies including substance abuse. As demonstrated by the fact that, in the worst cases, ongoing harassment can lead to suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm, which can ultimately result in death, and its effects can be disastrous both to the victim and the victim's family.
                    
                    We now utilize social media regularly, which frequently leads to more sudden instances of cyberbullying. Particularly in the current generation, it is crucial to understand certain tactics for stopping and preventing cyberbullying, as this is our shared responsibility.  To tackle cyberbullying, governments, families, schools, and individuals must collaborate. An essential first step is education. Young people may stop bullying by learning about empathy and most importantly internet etiquette, and the repercussions of their online behavior. In this topic, parents and guardians are also very crucial once it's educating their children’s about these as they are the first teachers and a reflection of their children’s actions and behavior whether in real life or online. If there is an open discussion about their experiences, a safe place where children who are being bullied online could be more comfortable speaking up and monitoring online activities without becoming overly intrusive might help strike a balance between privacy protection and safety which leads to a peaceful and safe online environment to anyone and everyone around the globe.
                    
                    In the end, stopping cyberbullying is essential, though it requires a lot such as a culture of empathy, accountability, and cooperation these things can help make our online world a better and safer place. By promoting empathy, respect and imbuing the core values of netiquette as being a digital netizen we can create a safer environment where everyone feels valued and protected. The first step in combating cyberbullying is again, for every one of us to take accountability and think about the consequences of what we say or do to others. It is a collective issue rather than just a personal one. Together, we can build a kind and upbeat online community where nobody has to face the pain of cyberbullying alone.
